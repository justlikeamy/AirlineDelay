# AirlineDelay
Using flight delay data to predict if a flight will or won't be delayed.

All preprocessing of the Airline Delay data is in AE_flight_preprocess.
My tests of various machine learning techniques for the inital binary classification problem is in AE_flight_classification.
In the end, I went back to see if I could classify the magnitude of the flight delay in AE_flight_regression.

Also presented is my final paper on the topic.
